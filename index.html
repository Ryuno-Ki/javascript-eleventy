              Welcome. This is my first time I'm talking at FOSDEM.
              You can follow along with the slides via the link.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the time this airs, I hope to be able to provide subtitles
              for download. The content will be close to speaker notes you can
              find behind the link.
            </p>
            <p>
              My name is André Jaenisch.
              I'm currently working as Software engineer at Jambit.
              It's a medium-sized software provider from Germany.
              This talk has no relationship with my work.
              Instead, it's a topic I'm highly interested in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since this reveal.js presentation is pre-recorded using OBS Studio,
              please ask your questions at the end.
              I would welcome if you would allow me to add your comments to
              the presentation slides afterwards. Please tell me if you want to
              opt-in.

            <p>Today I want to tell you something about Eleventy.</p>

              You will learn something about the people behind it,

              what the community did with it,
              where you can ask questions or
              how you can help.

            <p>Along the way we will see some possums.</p>
            <p>Eleventy's mascot is one. His name is Edison.</p>

            <p>As preparation for this talk, I did some research.</p>
            <p>
              Although I couldn't find the trivia behind its name,
              there are some interesting tidbits associated with the term.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term „Eleventy” came up in
              <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eleventy">
                Old English
              </a>,
              <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/eleventy">
                mid 19th century
              </a>.
              It became more popular with The Lord of the Rings by
              J. R. R. Tolkien.

            <p>I did some research, actually.</p>
            <p>Here, we can see a baby opposum.</a>
            <p>
              But there are other mammals called possum which live in
              Australia. I guess, it's American slang to call them the same.

            <p>Now the more important question:</p>
            <p>Why does Eleventy use an opossum as mascot?</p>

          <blockquote class="fragment">
            Think of a static site generator as a script which takes in data,
            content and templates, processes them, and outputs a folder full of
            all the resultant pages and assets.

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                There are a lot of Static Site Generators out there.
                They come in different shapes and
                flavours.
                Personally I used Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo and Grav before.
              </p>
              <p>
                But Eleventy has something, that makes it stand out to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                From its initial design goals, these are:
                Flexibility, Betting on JavaScript, not a JavaScript framework.
                You can find Zach's thoughts on this introduction blog post.
                Let's look at them in detail.

          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Flexibility</h3>
            <p>Mix and match template engines.</p>
            <p>Define input and output.</p>
            <p>Or use it as one-off script.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Flexibility</p>
              <p>
                You can mix and match template engines at will.
                Say, having Liquid because you started off with Jekyll.
                At one point, you want to benefit from Nunjucks. Easy with
                Eleventy!
              </p>
              <p>
                Eleventy even allows you to define a template inheritance chain
                - between different template languages if you feel like it!
              </p>
              <p>
                You are also free to choose input and output directory.
                Or even use it to transform a single file!

            <h3>Betting on JavaScript</h3>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Betting on JavaScript</p>
              <p>
                The JavaScript ecosystem is vast!
                I ran modulecounts against different module repositories.
                NPM clocks at 1.5 million in Jan 2021.
                That's a 1.5 and five zeroes! Followed by Maven with about
                370k Java modules. That's four times as much choice!
              </p>
              <p>
                You will likely find a library for every problem you can think
                of. Let's benefit from this fact.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hear your argument: That would be true for other Static Site
                Generators like Gatsby, too. Which leads us to …

            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Not a JavaScript framework</h3>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Not a JavaScript framework</p>
              <p>
                Unlike Gatsby, Eleventy does not force you to learn a JavaScript
                framework. It's plain Node.js. It does not recommend or enforce
                certain frameworks (by default). That being said, there are
                experiments to use it with Svelte or Vue.js.
              </p>
              <p>
                It neither forces you to use a certain template language.
                More about that later.

                but they did not make it to Gold sponsorship and thus don't
                appear on the screenshot.

                Now, what blew my mind was this Lightning Talk by
                Doctor Dan Fascia, who granted me permission to share some
                screenshots from YouTube with you.
                He works as Radiologist and Health Technologist.
                So not exactly what most of us do here for a living.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first two are websites, where he could repurpose some
                Nunjucks components, that were already written.
                But the last one is a <strong>whole conference</strong>
                built with Eleventy and some APIs. Go, watch the video.
                After my talk, of course :)

              <p>Let's shortly recap, what makes Eleventy special.</p>
              <p>It's easy to get started. You have the NPM behind you.</p>
              <p>
                Plugins fall into three categories. Filters take some content
                and transform it into something else to be used in-place.
                Shortcodes can be thought of as macros. So a placeholder for
                a larger code snippet.
                Transforms operate on a whole file.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can write your content in Markdown. Or plain HTML.
                (One of the pillars of Static Site Generators!)
              </p>
              <p>
                Next to the default collection generated from <code>tags</code>
                you can use a file glob. Or filter an existing collection.
              </p>
              <p>
                The async data used for directory files can be on disk.
                I'm curating an events list for example.
                Or you can fetch it over the wire. I'm pulling my tweets onto
                my website this way.

                There are different places the community is coming together.
                Originally, there was interaction via Twitter.
                Then, GitHub introduced Discussions and we use them next to
                plain old issues. If you have more shortlived questions, hop
                into the latest addition: a Discord server.

                I was surprised when it was introduced, but it makes kind of
                sense. If you maintain an Open Source library, you might want
                to adopt it.

              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, I picked some more advanced topics written by different

                Eleventy got enough traction, that the first training courses
                came up.

                Perhaps, you feel better with spending some money to get
                high-quality stuff in return. Andy Bell has you covered.
                I haven't taken his course personally, but I only hear positive
                feedback about it.

                If you want something sweat and short, Stephanie Eckles has
                something in stock.

                Not convinced? What about learning with Jason then? He recorded
                a video where Zach himself shows you the ropes.
