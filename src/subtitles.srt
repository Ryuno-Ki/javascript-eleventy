Meet Zach.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,900
Meet Zach.
He's the person, who created Eleventy.

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,650
He's the person, who created Eleventy.
Next to static site generators he's also interested into Web Fonts.

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,650
Next to static site generators he's also interested into Web Fonts.
You might also know him from conferences.

You might also know him from conferences.
Now, the important questions.

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,440
Now, the important questions.
Why a possum?

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,600
Why a possum?
I did some research, actually.

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I did some research, actually.
Here, we see a baby opposum.

44
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,900
Here, we see a baby opposum.
But there are other mammals called possums which live in Australia.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,680
But there are other mammals called possums which live in Australia.
I guess, it's American slang term to call them the same.

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,800
I guess, it's American slang term to call them the same.
Now the more important question:

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Now the more important question:
Why does Eleventy use an opposum as a mascot?

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,880
Why does Eleventy use an opposum as a mascot?
The answer is: 42.

49

The real answer is a homage to Zach's friend.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,460

So now:

51
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,960
So now:
Before we can continue, it is worth to define what we mean by Static Site Generator.

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,660
Before we can continue, it is worth to define what we mean by Static Site Generator.
I brought you a definition by Phil Hawksworth who works also at Netlify like Zach.

53
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,660
I brought you a definition by Phil Hawksworth who works also at Netlify like Zach.
Think of a Static Site Generator

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,060
Think of a Static Site Generator
as a script which takes in data, content and templates

55
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,960
as a script which takes in data, content and templates
processes them, and outputs a folder full of all the resultant pages and assets.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,960
processes them, and outputs a folder full of all the resultant pages and assets.
We will meet data, content and templates later again.

Flexibility
Betting on JavaScript

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,420
Betting on JavaScript
and not being a JavaScript framework.

66
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,900

With Eleventy you can mix and match template engines at will.

71
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,120
With Eleventy you can mix and match template engines at will.
Say, you have a Liquid template because you started off with Jekyll.

72

Eleventy even allows you to define a template inheritance chain

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,420
Eleventy even allows you to define a template inheritance chain
- between different template languages if you want!

76
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,000
- between different template languages if you want!
That means, you can start with a Liquid template, load that

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,220
That means, you can start with a Liquid template, load that
with a Nunjucks template which gets loaded by an

You are also free to choose input and output directory.

80
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,960
You are also free to choose input and output directory.
Or you even use Eleventy to transform a single file!

81
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,600
Or you even use Eleventy to transform a single file!

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
The JavaScript ecosystem is vast as you probably know!

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,680
The JavaScript ecosystem is vast as you probably know!
I ran modulecounts against different module repositories.

84

That's a 1.5 and five zeroes!
The next largest repository is Maven for Java which contains about 370k modules.

88
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,820
The next largest repository is Maven for Java which contains about 370k modules.
So Node.js has four times the amount of choices than Java!

89
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,160
So Node.js has four times the amount of choices than Java!
That means, you will likely find a library for every problem you can think of.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,520
That means, you will likely find a library for every problem you can think of.
Let's benefit from this fact.

Let's benefit from this fact.
I hear your argument:

92
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,140
I hear your argument:
That would be true for other Static Site Generators.

93
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,000
That would be true for other Static Site Generators.
Say Gatsby.

It does not recommend or enforce

99
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
It does not recommend or enforce
certain frameworks (by default).

100
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,500
certain frameworks (by default).
That being said, I'm aware of experiments to use it with Svelte or Vue.js.

101
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,000
That being said, I'm aware of experiments to use it with Svelte or Vue.js.
It neither forces you to use a certain template language.

After my talk, please.

143
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,000
So, let's shortly recap, what makes Eleventy so special.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,640
It's easy to get started.

145
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,640
You have the full power of the NPM ecosystem.

146
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,640
You have plugins which fall into three categories.

147
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,300
You have plugins which fall into three categories.
Filters

148
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,680
Filters
which take some input or take some content and transform it into something else which is then used in-place.

149
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
which take some input or take some content and transform it into something else which is then used in-place.
You have shortcodes

150
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,940
You have shortcodes
which can be thought of as a macro.

151
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,860
which can be thought of as a macro.
That means they are placeholder for a larger code snippet.

152
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,640
That means they are placeholder for a larger code snippet.
And you have transforms

153
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,580
And you have transforms
which operate on a whole file.

154
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,580
which operate on a whole file.

155
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,240
Then you can write your code or your content in Markdown.

156
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,420
Then you can write your code or your content in Markdown.
Or HTML.

Collections are generated by default from tags which you define in your frontmatter.

166
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,460

But you also have different other ways to define them,

167
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
But you also have different other ways to define them,
for example you can take a collection

168
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,180

filter it and create a new collection from that.

169

by defining a page size of 1.

179
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,620

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,240
Before we go into technical details,

183
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,790
Before we go into technical details,
